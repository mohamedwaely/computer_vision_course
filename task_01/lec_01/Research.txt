                            -----------------------------------------------------

- Computer vision has revolutionized the development of self-driving cars 
    by enabling vehicles to interpret and navigate their surroundings.
 
- By using cameras, sensors, and machine learning algorithms, 
    autonomous cars can detect objects, recognize traffic signs, 
    and make real-time decisions. 

- Technologies like YOLO (You Only Look Once) and TensorFlow have enhanced object detection speed and accuracy, 
    allowing cars to respond quickly to hazards. 

- This advancement has reduced the need for human intervention, increased road safety, 
    and paved the way for smarter transportation systems.

- Self-driving cars promise a future with fewer accidents, lower emissions, and more efficient traffic flow.
